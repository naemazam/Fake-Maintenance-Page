# Fake Cloudflare Error Page

## Overview

This project provides a **fake Cloudflare error page** that can be used when a website is down due to a user's fault. By using this page, the issue will appear to be on Cloudflare’s end, while the real issue is being quietly fixed on the user's side. It’s a humorous and convenient way to handle downtime situations without panic.

**Pro Tip:**  
If your site is down and it's your fault, just replace it with this fake Cloudflare error page. Everyone will blame Cloudflare while you quietly fix it. Thank me later. 😎
